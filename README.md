# Double_Linked_Circular_List
Implemented a doubly-linked circular list.<br />
Implemented sort command which can read in a given file one line at a time, and check correctness for each line. Then convert the line into an internal object/data structure, and insert the object/data structure into a list, sorted by the timestamp.
